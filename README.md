# Buket.Finance - A Multi-Algorithmic Token Pegged to 1 FTM via SEIGNIORAGE

Buket.Finance is an algorithmic stablecoin protocol where the money supply is dynamically adjusted to meet changes in money demand.

When demand is rising, the blockchain will create more Bukets. The expanded supply is designed to bring the Bukets price back down.
When demand is falling, the blockchain will buy back Bukets. The contracted supply is designed to restore Buekts price.

The Buekt Finance protocol is designed to expand and contract supply similarly to the way central banks buy and sell fiscal debt to stabilize purchasing power.
